# SnakeGame
A simple snake game using Gambas3

The idea of the game is to move the snake around and ‘eat’ all apples. The snake gets longer and faster the more you feed it.  Hit the edge of the play area and you’ll DIE!! Eat the snakes own tail and you DIE!! 

Use the arrow keys to start and change direction. Press the spacebar to restart the game the game.
